### Check out some of my projects

- [AudioClassificationPyTorch](https://github.com/Fosowl/AudioClassificationPyTorch) : A Deep Learning based audio classifier made with PyTorch.
- [ReinforcementLearningGym](https://github.com/Fosowl/ReinforcementLearningGym) : A solution to some of openAI gym's problems using Reinforcement Learning, an agent has to learn by itself to learn the reward and action to perform in a game.
- [monocularSlam](https://github.com/Fosowl/monocularSlam) : Implementation of Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using a monocular camera feed, this allow 3d world reconstruction based off a car dashcam video.
-  [Circuit Simulator](https://github.com/Fosowl/CircuitSimulator) : An electronic circuit simulator build in C++.
- [Reddittech](https://github.com/Fosowl/Reddittech) : Implementation of Reddit-like mobile app in react native.
- [S.T.A.R.S.E.T-Game-Engine](https://github.com/Fosowl/S.T.A.R.S.E.T-Game-Engine) : A game engine made in C from scratch.
- [FlightRadar24-like-simulation](https://github.com/Fosowl/FlightRadar24-like-simulation) : A graphical simulation of airplane flying on a map, made in C.
