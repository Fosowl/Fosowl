ðŸ‘‹ I am Martin from south of France, Epitech 2024 graduate, I also studied at Feng Chia University é€¢ç”²å¤§å­¸.

**I usually build AI stuff:**

[ðŸ’» AgenticSeek](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek)
A fully local alternative to Manus AI and other cloud-tied agents.

[ðŸŽ§ SoundGan](https://github.com/Fosowl/SoundGan)
A full pipeline for training GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate audio. from dataset download to training. (kinda broken, will fix)

[ðŸŽ® ReinforcementLearningGym](https://github.com/Fosowl/ReinforcementLearningGym)
Solutions to classic OpenAI Gym environments using reinforcement learning.
Watch agents learn to walk one episode at a time. Then get stuck with exploding gradients (I am still a noob with rl).

[ðŸš˜ monocularSlam](https://github.com/Fosowl/monocularSlam)
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with monocular camera input.
Real-time 3D world reconstruction from car dashcam footage. Inspired by *Geohot* Twitchslam.

I hope my effort can make a small difference in making AI more community driven.

It still blows my mind that AgenticSeek took off like it did. With that growth comes a lot of new responsibilities, if youâ€™ve found value in AgenticSeek consider buying me a coffee.
